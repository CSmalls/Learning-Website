		Candy Michelle Smallwood, Esq. Bar Exam Tutor and Tenant Lawyer in San Francisco
		What can we offer you?

		I can offer a proven system, guidance, patience, and an understanding of whatâ€™s needed to pass the exam and support to help you get there. I believe that everyone has what it takes to pass the California Bar Exam, but it takes a lot of work, repetition, self-analysis, and determination.

		Contact me and let us talk about how I can help you prepare for Your Bar Exam.
